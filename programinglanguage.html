    <h1 style="color:green;">Python:- </h1>
    <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding,<br>
      make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.<br> Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.<br>
      Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. <br>Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault.<br>
      Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, <br>the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. <br>The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: <br>
      the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.

        <h1 style="color:green;">HTML:- </h1>
        </body>

      <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br> It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <br>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
        </p>
        <p>Let’s compare HTML to the human form. HTML is what gives a skeleton to all of our features. It supports the head and the body of a person. <br>
          To give a clearer understanding of this, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) would be what gives us our features, like the colour of our eyes, skin and hair.<br> And JavaScript would be to do with our movements and how we interact with people – like when we reciprocate a handshake, wink, laugh or ask a question.<br>

          As technology grows, so too does its use within business. <br>
          To see how vital HTML and technology is to business, take your smartphone out of your pocket. How many apps do you have? How often do you use the browsers? <br>
          Do you use it for shopping or to use purchases? Does it control things, like the temperature of your home? Do you use it to book hotels, flights, haircuts, <br>
          or anything else? Do you use it to order food or to listen to or watch something online? To a certain degree, <br>
          do you depend on it?</p>

      <h1 style="color:green;">CSS:- </h1>
      <p><u><b>Cascading Style Sheets</u> (CSS)</b> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
        <br>[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
        <br>[2]CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
        <br>[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
        </p>
        <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.
          <br> CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]</p>
          <h4><u>Syntax</u></h4>
    <p>CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties.
      A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.</p>
    <h4><u>Selector</u></h4>
    <p>In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.
      Selectors may apply to the following:

      all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
      elements specified by attribute, in particular:
      id: an identifier unique within the document, identified with a hash prefix e.g. #id
      class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, identified with a period prefix e.g. .classname
      elements depending on how they are placed relative to
      <h4><u>Declaration block</u></h4>
      <p>A declaration block consists of a list of declarations in braces. Each declaration itself consists of a property, a colon (:), <Br>
        and a value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon (;) must be inserted to separate each declaration. An optional semi-colon after the last (or single) declaration may be used.[9]
